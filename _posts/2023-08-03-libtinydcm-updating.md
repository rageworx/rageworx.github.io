## libtinydicom is updating now

[libtinydcm ](https://github.com/rageworx/libtinydicom) is a tiny stdc++ library that supports multi platforms with minimal C++11 standard.

DICOM dictionary is still in implementation progress but library itself is definitely being updated to support latest standard of DICOM 2023(b).

Anyone can contribute to project !
