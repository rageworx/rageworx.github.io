Most of macOS users should not met like `lsusb` of Linux, And I also needed it to check what USB device connected and where it belong to port.

So I made an utility to check "connected USB list" as like "lsusb".

Most of homebrew users may know unfunctional `lsusb` from linux-utils for macOS, and this is a shortly escape way to unfamiliar looks `lsusb` to check your USB devices.
